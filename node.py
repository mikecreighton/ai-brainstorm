class Node:
    """
    A Node class representing an idea in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for brainstorming.

    This class encapsulates the structure and behavior of nodes in the search tree,
    including problem statements, generated ideas, and their evaluations.

    Attributes:
        QUALITY_THRESHOLD (float): The score threshold for considering a node as high-quality.
        C_PARAM (float): Exploration parameter for the UCT formula in MCTS.
        MAX_DEPTH (int): Maximum depth allowed for the search tree.
        MAX_CHILDREN (int): Maximum number of children allowed for each node.

    Each node contains:
    - Content of the idea
    - Constraints applicable to the idea
    - Reference to parent and child nodes
    - Visit count and score for MCTS
    - Depth in the tree and position among siblings
    - Unique identifier and parent's identifier
    - The creative directive used to generate this idea (if applicable)

    Methods are provided for score calculation, position information, and
    determining if a node is terminal or fully expanded.

        """
        
        The UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound 1) selection in the `best_child` method is a key part of the MCTS algorithm.
        Here's a simple explanation of what it's doing:

        1. **Balancing exploration and exploitation**: UCB1 helps choose which child node to explore next, balancing between:
            - Exploitation: Choosing nodes that have performed well so far
            - Exploration: Giving a chance to less-visited nodes that might be promising

        2. **The formula**: For each child, it calculates a score using this formula:
            ```
            (child.score / child.visits) + C_PARAM * sqrt((2 * log(self.visits)) / child.visits)
            ```

        3. **Components of the formula**:
            - `child.score / child.visits`: This is the average score of the child (exploitation)
            - `C_PARAM * sqrt((2 * log(self.visits)) / child.visits)`: This is the exploration bonus
            - `C_PARAM` (usually âˆš2) controls the balance between exploration and exploitation

        4. **Selection**: It calculates this score for all visited children and chooses the one with the highest score.

        5. **Handling edge cases**: 
            - If a child hasn't been visited, it's not included in the calculation
            - If no children have been visited, it randomly selects a child

        This method ensures that the algorithm doesn't just focus on the currently best-performing paths but also explores
        less-visited options that might turn out to be better in the long run.
